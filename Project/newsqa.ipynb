      "\t-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Kellogg 's dumped its endorsement of Michael Phelps after a photograph surfaced of the Olympic gold medalist using a bong , the company was stuck with thousands of boxes of cereal featuring the swimmer 's image . Kellogg 's ended its Michael Phelps endorsement , so it sent two tons of cereal with his face on it to a food bank . No problem . The company , based in Battle Creek , Michigan , made short order of the already-printed and filled boxes , donating two tons of cereal to the San Francisco Food Bank late last month . With food banks across the country reporting shortages of food , the donation was a welcome one , said the food bank 's director of development , Christopher Wiley . It took only two weeks for about 3,000 boxes to move through warehouse . '' Thousands of families benefited from the donation '' Wiley said . `` It was a surprise to us . We were lacking a lot of cereal . It is a great product many low-income families really need . '' `` The real story for us was not the box but what 's inside the box . The food is so valuable for the community . It 's making good from bad , '' Wiley said . The food bank has seen a 6 percent increase in its customer base since the beginning of the year , he said . Phelps , 23 , won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing , China . He admitted `` regrettable behavior '' after a British newspaper published the controversial photograph in early February . The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina in Columbia . A bong is a device commonly used to smoke marijuana . The Phelps box attracted considerable attention to the food bank . Administrators received several calls from people wanting to get the box as a novelty item . But , said Wiley , all the cereal went to food bank customers . Kellogg 's was the only one of Phelps sponsors to drop the athlete , although U.S.A. Swimming , the nation 's governing body for competitive swimming , suspended him for three months , withdrew financial support and barred him from competition during the period of his `` reprimand . '' CNN 's Jackie Castillo and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report .\n",

      "\t-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 14-year-old Filipino-American boy abducted in July by suspected Islamic militants in the Philippines is free , officials said . Kevin Lunsmann was reunited with his mother , the U.S. Embassy in Manila said Monday , without offering additional details . '' It was a tough time . It was a tough five months , '' Kevin 's father , Heiko , told CNN affiliate WSET , from the family home in Lynchburg , Virginia . '' I 'm just so happy . '' Heiko Lunsmann said the boy had plotted his escape for a while and eventually seized the opportunity some time late last week while his guards slept . He `` was spotted alone '' Saturday about six miles southwest of Lamitan City on the island of Basilan , a stronghold of the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf , the official Philippines News Agency said . Army officials turned him over to American forces in the southern Mindanao region , the Philippine government said in a statement to CNN affiliate TV 5 . The Philippine Inquirer quoted the Lamitan city mayor , Roderick Furigay , as saying Kevin walked for two days , surviving on candies his captors presumably gave him and on coconuts that he retrieved by climbing trees . `` In this holiday season nothing makes me happier than knowing that an innocent victim is returned to his family in time for holiday celebrations , '' Harry Thomas , the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines , said in a weekend statement . `` If ever we are to be inspired by the human spirit , we should take comfort in the courage , commitment and love that the Lunsmann family exhibited during this trying ordeal , '' Thomas added . Fourteen gunmen snatched Kevin , his mother , Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann , and his 19-year-old cousin , Romnick Jakaria , in July while they vacationed on the island of Tictabon , authorities said . The abductors forced them to board awaiting boats , which then sped off in the direction of Basilan . Kevin 's mother was released by her captors in October . Jakaria was released last month , according to the news agency . Basilan serves as a base for Abu Sayyaf , which wants to establish a separate state for the Philippines ' minority Muslim population . The U.S. State Department considers the group a terrorist organization and says it is linked to al Qaeda . The Philippines government has been fighting to contain the militants . Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for several terrorist attacks in the Philippines , including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead , as well as past kidnappings . Basilan 's governor called on authorities Sunday to prosecute the alleged kidnappers of the Lunsmann family , according to the news agency . `` The prosecution of kidnappers by a court of law will put a stop to kidnappings , '' the news agency quoted Jum Akbar as saying . Thomas , the U.S. ambassador , said the crime will not go `` unpunished . '' Gerfa Lunsmann was adopted by Americans when she was 9 and grew up in Virginia . She eventually married a German citizen . Both she and the son , Kevin , are U.S. passport holders . Kevin 's father told WSET that the boy will eventually share his story of escape , but did not say when . `` I can tell you a lot of things , but I only know that he is a hero , '' he said .

      "\tNew York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Alec Baldwin closed out the Academy Awards on Sunday night by slapping director Kathryn Bigelow squarely on the backside , that pretty much said it all . It was Ladies ' Night in a Boys ' Town . Yes , the opening routine by Baldwin and Steve Martin was very funny ; there was sincerity and genuine gratitude from many of the winners ; despite weird digressions into arcane areas like sound recording , the program moved briskly enough . But did the orchestra need to follow Bigelow 's win of her long-deserved best director prize , for `` The Hurt Locker , '' by playing the old Helen Reddy song `` I Am Woman '' ? When Zoe Saldana and Carey Mulligan arrived on stage to present the Best Original Song award , did they have to be intro-ed with `` Thank Heaven For Little Girls '' ? And in addition to being groped by Baldwin , did Bigelow have to be so muscled-in-on by her fellow producers when she was picking up the best picture award for her film , `` The Hurt Locker '' ? ` The Hurt Locker ' wins six Oscars Maybe that wacky Elinor Burkett had a point : The producer of `` Music by Prudence '' -- which had just won the Oscar for best documentary short -- barreled on stage , saying `` Let the woman speak ! '' and commandeering the mike from her director , Roger Ross Williams . She provided a classic moment of Oscar craziness and the one instance of spontaneity in an evening when all the big favorites won all the big prizes . Burkett seemed boorish , sure . But that does n't necessarily make her wrong . The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences certainly faced a dilemma this year : Vote for the future , or make up for the past . Years from now , it will probably look profoundly shortsighted that `` Avatar , '' one of the biggest movies ever -- and , more importantly , the one that indicates where movies are going -- did n't win the top prize when Hollywood had a chance to bestow it . Instead , the Oscars gave their most coveted awards to a small indie film about an unpopular war and a director whose sex had never before been honored with a best director prize . What helped make it all so complicated was not that there 's been a long , long history of overlooked genius female directors that the Oscars had to atone for . The sin at stake was -- and is -- that women simply have never been given an equal chance to direct . Predictably , Bigelow did n't have to be as good as the boys , she had to be better . And she was . But earning your Oscars and actually getting them are two different things . Fortunately for Bigelow , she had history on her side last night . James Cameron did n't . The billions being made by `` Avatar '' will probably be some consolation , but neither he nor his movie are warm and fuzzy , which is what the Academy voters like . In fact , the big-hearted , sentimental acceptance by best actor Jeff Bridges -LRB- `` Crazy Heart '' -RRB- , and the rather elegant , funny remarks by best actress Sandra Bullock -LRB- `` The Blind Side '' -RRB- , are exactly what we all want Oscar night to be . That , and a few good jokes , which is what Martin and Baldwin provided , arriving on stage after a musical extravaganza starring Neil Patrick Harris that seemed ready to recall the bad old days of producer Alan Carr and the notorious Rob Lowe/Snow White musical overture of 1989 . Looking back on Oscar 's ` train wreck ' Nothing so ghastly reared its ugly head last night , although there were a few moments of bad choices , bad manners and a strategy that was , at best , elusive . For all the changing characters and categories on Oscar-watchers ' betting pool ballots , there are certain things we bet on no matter what : one , that the show will be interminable ; two , that it will last at least until midnight -LRB- ET -RRB- no matter how they try to contain it ; and , three , that there will be moments in the show itself that , although planned by seemingly sane individuals , will be inexplicable , if not grotesque . Last night did not disappoint . While someone like poor Tivi Magnusson got drowned out by the orchestra -LRB- after he and Joachim Back won best live action short for `` The New Tenants '' -RRB- , the show 's producers thought it made perfect sense to devote relatively huge chunks of time to examining the niceties of animated short subjects or providing weary viewers the inevitable , unspeakable interpretive dance number , this one devoted to the evening 's musical scores . More painful , at least to this viewer 's eyes , was an overlong salute to the late director John Hughes , featuring a reunion of some of his more famous players , a few of whom -- Molly Ringwald , for instance , and Judd Nelson -- looked positively shell shocked . The only surprises of the night were in the best foreign film category : The Argentine `` El Secreto de Sus Ojos , '' beat out the favored `` White Ribbon , '' thus continuing the Oscar tradition of giving the foreign-film prize to something few have even seen -LRB- a foreign-film Oscar does n't do much good , one should remember , for a movie that 's already opened and closed -RRB- . The other surprise was the rudeness with which costume designer Sandy Powell accepted her `` Young Victoria '' Oscar . `` I 've already got two of these , '' she said , before dissing her coworkers and , by extension , the Academy in toto . Brusque dismissal is not a quality Oscar tolerates very well and it 's not likely Ms. Powell will be back , unlike Martin and Baldwin , who were the funniest Oscar hosts ever , proving there 's power in numbers , the sum often can be more than the parts , and that it 's always good to have an extra pair of hands , as long as they stay off Kathryn Bigelow 's butt . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Anderson .\n",
